Steps
• Install RHEL Server 6.3 from the Legacy BIOS (not UEFI) and selected the "Software development" installation
• NOTE:  RHEL 6.5 is not compatible with the BIOS for this computer
• Configured the em1 interface for DHCP and connected to external network
• Alternatively, use the Red Hat Subscription Manager instead (this is the newer, preferred method)
• Add the optional repo to the yum configuration
For Red Hat Subscription Management
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms

• As root, run yum upgrade to upgrade all existing packages.  This will take a while.
• The following packages need to be installed according to David Rogers
∘ cmake 2.6.4-5
∘ cppunit 1.12.1-3.1
∘ cheetah 2.4.1-1
∘ wxBase 2.8.12-1
∘ wxPython 2.8.12.0-1
∘ jack-audio-connection 0.121.3-1
∘ portaudio 19-9
∘ log4cpp 1.0-13
∘ comedilib 0.8.1-7
∘ uhd 3.5 (build from source)
• We will be installing GNU Radio and UHD from source, and building.  This allows us to get the most up-to-date code.  The packages (.rpm) for Fedora *should* work with RedHat, but they won't be the latest version.  Could also install from pre-compiled tarballs.  However, the best way to keep up to date with the latest code is to pull the source from GitHub and build manually.
• Install GNU radio dependencies as per
http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/build_guide.html
Note:  Probably don't need the qt and qwt dependencies (we are using wx), but I wanted to install them anyway just in case we later decide to use qt instead of wx for the GUI
