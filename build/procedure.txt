NOTE:  When installing Linux for the first time, be sure to make a separate
partition for /var.  This can be done by adding a primary partition or by
using Logical Volume Mangagement (LVM).  Newer distros use LVM because it is
flexible since LV's can be added or resized later.

NOTE: If you didn't make a special partition and used the default Red Hat Install
(they use LVM for /home and /), you can move /var over to a separate partition
by following the procedure "create_var_partition.odt"

To change from Guest network (needed for software installs) to Argon network
(JIRA, Stash, etc)

To the Argon!

service network stop
mv ifcfg-eth0 0ifcfg-eth0
mv 0ifcfg-p3p1 ifcfg-p3p1
service network start
echo "search argon.local lh.argoneng.com" >> /etc/resolv.conf

mv 0ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0
service network start

Steps
• Install RHEL Server 6.3 from the Legacy BIOS (not UEFI) and selected the "Software development" installation
• NOTE:  RHEL 6.5 is not compatible with the BIOS for this computer
• Configured the em1 interface for DHCP and connected to external network
• Alternatively, use the Red Hat Subscription Manager instead (this is the newer, preferred method)
• Add the optional repo to the yum configuration
For Red Hat Subscription Management
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms

• As root, run yum upgrade to upgrade all existing packages.  This will take a while.
• We will be installing GNU Radio and UHD from source, and building.  This allows us to get the most up-to-date code.  The packages (.rpm) for Fedora *should* work with RedHat, but they won't be the latest version.  Could also install from pre-compiled tarballs.  However, the best way to keep up to date with the latest code is to pull the source from GitHub and build manually.
• Install GNU radio dependencies as per
http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/build_guide.html
Note:  Probably don't need the qt and qwt dependencies (we are using wx), but I wanted to install them anyway just in case we later decide to use qt instead of wx for the GUI
