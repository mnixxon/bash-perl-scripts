NOTE:  When installing Linux for the first time, be sure to make a separate
partition for /var.  This can be done by adding a primary partition or by
using Logical Volume Mangagement (LVM).  Newer distros use LVM because it is
flexible since LV's can be added or resized later.

NOTE: If you didn't make a special partition and used the default Red Hat Install
(they use LVM for /home and /), you can move /var over to a separate partition
by following the procedure "create_var_partition.odt"

To change from Guest network (needed for software installs) to Argon network
(JIRA, Stash, etc)

To the Argon!

service network stop
mv ifcfg-eth0 0ifcfg-eth0
mv 0ifcfg-p3p1 ifcfg-p3p1
service network start
echo "search argon.local lh.argoneng.com" >> /etc/resolv.conf
set up automatic proxy in Firefox

To the Internet!

service network stop
mv ifcfg-p3p1 0ifcfg-p3p1
mv 0ifcfg-eth0 ifcfg-eth0
service network start

Steps
• Install RHEL Server 6.3 from the Legacy BIOS (not UEFI) and selected the "Software development" installation
• NOTE:  RHEL 6.5 is not compatible with the BIOS for this computer
• Configured the em1 interface for DHCP and connected to external network
• Alternatively, use the Red Hat Subscription Manager instead (this is the newer, preferred method)
• Add the optional repo to the yum configuration
For Red Hat Subscription Management
sudo yum-config-manager --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms

Also add the EPEL repositories
wget http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm 
rpm -ivh epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm
yum repolist

After running `yum repolist` you should be able to see that the EPEL repo as
been added.

• As root, run yum upgrade to upgrade all existing packages.  This will take a while.
• We will be installing GNU Radio and UHD from source, and building.  This allows us to get the most up-to-date code.  The packages (.rpm) for Fedora *should* work with RedHat, but they won't be the latest version.  Could also install from pre-compiled tarballs.  However, the best way to keep up to date with the latest code is to pull the source from GitHub and build manually.
• Install GNU radio dependencies as per
http://gnuradio.org/doc/doxygen/build_guide.html
Note:  Probably don't need the qt and qwt dependencies (we are using wx), but I wanted to install them anyway just in case we later decide to use qt instead of wx for the GUI

Build from source
Make a directory called 'repos' under /
All source code pulled from GitHub will be stored here.

uhd (http://code.ettus.com/redmine/ettus/projects/uhd/wiki/UHD_Build)
Now using uhd 3.71 (needs to get approved by security)

gnu radio from piranha-gnuradio repo on stash.
On the argon network, do 
git clone <repo>
http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/InstallingGRFromSource

Bash shell customizations
To add custom stuff to everyone's bash shell, you can add .sh files to the
/etc/profile.d/ folder.

Add the following files to /etc/profile.d/
git.sh
gnuradio.sh
better_bash.sh

Git custom stuff
Copy over the gitconfig file
cp gitconfig /etc/gitconfig
sudo chmod a+r /etc/gitconfig

Set up Meld as custom diff and merge tool
Add the following files to /usr/local/bin
extDiff
extMerge
Make sure that it is executable
chmod 775 /usr/local/bin/ext*

Need to install pam.i686 (32-bit PAM libraries) to make the webpage work
yum install pam.686

Also I had to modify the bash install script and modify the checkAccess
function to be echo "Bypassing checkAccess function" because it was causing
the script to fail.

### Setting up yum repos ###
Create custom yum repo for doing updates on closed networks

yum install createrepo
mkdir repos/yum
createrepo --database /repos/yum/
touch /etc/yum.repos.d/local-updates.repo
chmod 644 local-updates.repo
vim local-updates.repo

Add the following info to the file
[rhel-6-local-updates]
name = RHEL 6 Server local updates (Red Hat and EPEL)
baseurl = file:///repos/yum
enabled = 1

Before deploying the build to a close network, disable the other remote repos
by changing everything to `enabled = 0`

Add additional useful yum plugins

yum install yum-plugin-security
yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly

The security plugin lets you only grab the security affected updates
`yum upgrade --security` will only update security relavent packages
The downloadonly plugin lets you download rpm packages through yum
without actually installing them on a system.

Track future updates to RHEL 6

To update RHEL 6 packages
yum upgrade

To keep track of all the updates that were done on the unclass build
computer, edit the yum.conf file to save all of the packages that
have been installed.  Then those packages can be brought to the closed
network and placed in the /repo/yum folder and installed via the 
`yum install` command, assuming the repo has been set up.

In the yum.conf file, change
keepcache = 1

Now, all packages will be saved in /var/cache/yum/<repo>/packages

To copy files from the cache to your local yum repo

find /var/cache/yum/ -name "*.rpm" | xargs cp -t /repos/yum

To disable remote Red Hat and EPEL repositories (do this on closed networks)

yum-config-manager --disable epel
yum-config-manager --disable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms
num-config-manager --disable rhel-6-server-rpms

Once the other repos are disabled, you will need to clean the cache of the
rhel-6-local-udpates repo

yum clean all

Then need to update the metadata for the database
createrepo --update /repos/yum

Then you can update existing packages by using
yum upgrade

Or install new packages
yum install <packages> --skip-broken

### Last minute GNU radio additions ###
Add this to the /etc/group file
@usrp:x:id:username1, username2, etc

Add this to limits.conf
@usrp - rtprio 50

Add this to sysctl.conf
net.core.rmem_max=50000000
net.core.wmem_max=1048576

Disable 'iptables' service (this was causing issues auto-finding Ettus radios).
Note that we can probably configure iptables to work with the Ettus radios, but that would require spending time reading the 50 page man page on how iptables work.

Might need to also disable the 'nails' service since this seems to break java.

sudo service iptables stop


### To automount home directories on Rose
cp sshfs_script.sh /opt/scripts/
chmod 755 sshfs_script.sh
cp sshfs_script.sh.desktop /etc/xds/autostart/
chmod 644 sshfs_script.sh.desktop
